SASS (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) and SCSS (Sassy CSS) are both preprocessor scripting languages that compile into CSS. 
They make writing stylesheets more efficient and maintainable by introducing features that are not available in regular CSS, 
such as variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance, and more.

SASS

    Syntax: Indentation-based (similar to Python).
    File Extension: .sass
    Features:
        No curly braces {} or semicolons ;.
        Simpler and more concise syntax but requires strict indentation.

$primary-color: #3498db

body
  background-color: $primary-color

nav
  ul
    margin: 0
    padding: 0
    list-style: none
SCSS

    Syntax: CSS-like syntax with the added features of SASS.
    File Extension: .scss
    Features:
        Uses curly braces {} and semicolons ; like traditional CSS.
        Easier for developers familiar with CSS to adapt.

$primary-color: #3498db;

body {
  background-color: $primary-color;
}

nav {
  ul {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    list-style: none;
  }
}
